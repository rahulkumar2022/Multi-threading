Life Cycle
1. New
2. Runnable
3. Running
4. Non-Runnable(Blocked)
5. Terminated


Ways of thread implemetation
1. extends Thread class
2. implement Runnable Interface

Extending Thread class
- override run() method which is entry point for
  of new Thread

Implementing Runnable Interface
- After implementing runnable interface, class needs to implement
  runnable thr run() method, which is public void run()
  - Thread will end when run() when run method returns.
  

Difference between Runnable and Thread
- Implementing Runnable is preffered.
- Implementing Runnable makes class more felxible. If you extend Thread then the action you're doing is 
  always going to be in a thread.
  However, if I implement Runnable it doesn't have to be. You can run it in a thread, or pass it to some 
  kind of executor service, or just pass or around always a task within a single threaded application


1.) What is the difference between Process and Thread?
 => Both processes and threads are independent sequences of execution.
  The typical difference is that threads run in a shared memory space, while
   processes run in separate memory spaces.
